# Code in Place Final Project
## Basic version using Matplotlib

## About

This is my final project for the Stanford Code In Place course. I am exploring data science as this isn't something I've done as much of as I've mainly been working with JavaScript prior to this.

I have chosen to analyse some COVID19 vaccine data from the UK. I may expand this to global/cases per day.
Think about using github (large dataset)? User can input their country or random, or overlay some other data.

### Demo

Space to include a screenshot if applicable.

### Built with

* Python
* Seaborn

## Prerequisites & Installation

* the latest version of python (3.9)
* seaborn (and dependency packages)
* I used a conda environment, but this is optional

## Usage

Load the project in your IDE(I used PyCharm) and run to see the data.

## Licence

Distributed under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) licence.

All data is property of the UK government and available at https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations.
